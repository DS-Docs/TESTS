a) 5% chance of accepting the null hypothesis
b) 5% chance of rejecting a true null hypothesis
c) 95% confidence in the null hypothesis
d) 5% data variability
Answer: b) 5% chance of rejecting a true null hypothesis
Explanation: A significance level (Î±) of 0.05 means a 5% risk of Type I error (false positive).

8. What is the purpose of a t-test?
a) To compare means of groups
b) To measure correlation
c) To calculate variance

a) Accepting a false null hypothesis
b) Rejecting a true null hypothesis
c) Accepting a true null hypothesis
d) Rejecting a false null hypothesis
Answer: b) Rejecting a true null hypothesis
Explanation: A Type I error (false positive) occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is incorrectly rejected.

10. What is a Type II error?
a) Rejecting a true null hypothesis
b) Accepting a false null hypothesis
c) Calculating incorrect variance
d) Using the wrong test statistic
Answer: b) Accepting a false null hypothesis
Explanation: A Type II error (false negative) occurs when the null hypothesis is false but is not rejected.

11. What is the formula for the sample variance?
a) Î£(x - Î¼)Â² / N

c) Î£(x - xÌ) / n
d) Î£xÂ² / n
Answer: b) Î£(x - xÌ)Â² / (n - 1)
Explanation: Sample variance uses n - 1 to correct for bias in estimating population variance from a sample.

12. What is a normal distribution?
a) A skewed distribution
b) A bell-shaped distribution
c) A uniform distribution
d) A discrete distribution
Answer: b) A bell-shaped distribution
Explanation: A normal distribution is symmetric, bell-shaped, and characterized by its mean and standard deviation.

a) Percentages of data within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations
b) Confidence intervals for hypothesis tests
c) Probabilities of Type I errors
d) Correlation coefficients
Answer: a) Percentages of data within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations
Explanation: In a normal distribution, 68% of data lies within 1 SD, 95% within 2 SDs, and 99.7% within 3 SDs.

14. What is the purpose of a confidence interval?
a) To calculate variance
b) To estimate a population parameter
c) To test correlation
d) To measure skewness

15. What is the correlation coefficient?
a) A measure of data spread
b) A measure of linear relationship strength
c) A test statistic
d) A probability value
Answer: b) A measure of linear relationship strength
Explanation: The correlation coefficient (e.g., Pearsonâs r) ranges from -1 to 1, indicating the strength and direction of a linear relationship.

16. What is a chi-square test used for?
a) Comparing means
b) Testing independence or goodness of fit
c) Measuring correlation
d) Estimating variance
Answer: b) Testing independence or goodness of fit

a) A measure of correlation
b) The number of standard deviations from the mean
c) A test statistic for chi-square tests
d) The sample size
Answer: b) The number of standard deviations from the mean

a) The mean equals the median
b) Sample means approximate a normal distribution
c) Variance equals standard deviation
d) Data is always normally distributed
Answer: b) Sample means approximate a normal distribution
