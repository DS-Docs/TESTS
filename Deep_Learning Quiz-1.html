            <div class="answer" id="answer1">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> C) TensorFlow</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> TensorFlow is a popular open-source library developed by Google for deep learning applications. While NumPy and Pandas are used for numerical computing and data manipulation respectively, TensorFlow is specifically designed for building and training neural networks.</p>

            <div class="answer" id="answer2">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> B) To introduce non-linearity into the network</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Activation functions like ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh introduce non-linearity to the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns. Without activation functions, the neural network would essentially be just a linear regression model regardless of how many layers it had.</p>

            <div class="answer" id="answer4">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> B) One complete pass through the entire training dataset</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> An epoch refers to one complete cycle through the full training dataset. Multiple epochs are typically needed for the model to learn effectively. For example, if you have 1000 training examples and use batches of 100, it would take 10 iterations to complete 1 epoch.</p>

                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A) Adam</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) is a popular optimization algorithm for deep learning that combines the advantages of two other extensions of stochastic gradient descent: AdaGrad and RMSProp. The other options are machine learning algorithms, not optimizers.</p>

            <div class="answer" id="answer8">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A) To measure how well the model is performing</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The loss function (also called cost function) quantifies how far the model's predictions are from the actual values. During training, the optimizer tries to minimize this loss function. Common loss functions include mean squared error for regression and cross-entropy for classification.</p>

            <div class="answer" id="answer9">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> B) Sigmoid</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The sigmoid function is often used in the output layer for binary classification because it squashes the output between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as a probability. ReLU and its variants are more commonly used in hidden layers, while softmax is used for multi-class classification.</p>

            <div class="answer" id="answer10">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A) They reduce the number of parameters through weight sharing</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Convolutional layers use filters/kernels that are slid across the input image, sharing weights across different spatial locations. This makes them much more efficient than fully connected layers for image data and allows them to detect features regardless of their position in the image.</p>

            <div class="answer" id="answer11">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A) Using ReLU activation functions</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation functions help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem because their derivative is either 0 (for negative inputs) or 1 (for positive inputs), unlike sigmoid or tanh functions whose derivatives can become very small. Other techniques include proper weight initialization and residual connections.</p>

                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Batch normalization normalizes the inputs to a layer for each mini-batch, which helps stabilize and accelerate the training of deep neural networks. It reduces internal covariate shift (the change in the distribution of layer inputs) and allows for higher learning rates.</p>

            <div class="answer" id="answer21">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A) It determines the size of the steps taken during optimization</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The learning rate controls how much we adjust the weights of our network with respect to the loss gradient. A too high learning rate might cause the model to overshoot the minimum, while a too low learning rate might make training very slow or get stuck in local minima.</p>

                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Early stopping is a form of regularization that stops training when the model's performance on a validation set starts to worsen, indicating that further training might lead to overfitting. This helps find the optimal point where the model has learned enough without memorizing the training data.</p>
